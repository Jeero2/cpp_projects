## **Constructor overloading**
If more than one constructor is used in a class, it is called _constructor  overloading._ All the constructors have same name but they differ in number of arguments and datatypes of arguments.

Depending upon number and datatype of arguments, the constructor is called.  
### Things To Remember:
1. Arguments should be passed when the object is created.
2. The name of all the constructors must be same but the data type or the number of arguments must be different.
3. The constructors must be defined within the same class.
4. The default constructor is always called even if we do not create any constructor.i.e default constructor is always present.
