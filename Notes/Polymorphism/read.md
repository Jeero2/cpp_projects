## Polymorphism [Poly - Many and Morphism - Forms]

1. The word polymorphism means having many forms.
2. The term Polymorphism means the ability to take many forms. It occurs if there is a hierarchy of classes which are all related to each other by inheritance.
3. C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

## Compile Time Polymorphism

### Also called **Early Binding** , **Static Polymorphism**

> Note: In early binding,the function call is fixed before the program is executed as the function is set during the compilation of the program

 ### 1. Achieved during Compile Time
 ### 2. Method Overloading

## Run Time Polymorphism

### Also called **Late Binding** , **Dynamic Polymorphism** 

 ### 1. Achieved during Runtime
 ### 2. Method Overriding
